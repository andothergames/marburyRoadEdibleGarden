<p>Fundraising forage with the friends of Chadkirk Chapel
The friends of Chadkirk Chapel are hosting an introduction to wild food walk and would like to open up an invitation to you to join us in a bid to raise some funds for their community group whilst getting to know the plants that surround them and their practical uses.</p>

<p>We will meet outside the beautiful Chadkirk Chapel at 12:30 and look at some of the plants in their beautiful walled garden, then we will head out to meet some woodland plants and stop to skim some stones whilst we look at the ID features of a highly invasive plant that spreads down our waterways and snack on some vegan produce made from its flowers and drink some home brewed cordials.</p>

<p>This walk has been made possible thanks to the Proper Good seed fund - a series of meals turned into micro grants that are awarded to pitchers by the diners' votes. If you voted for us to win the funding please get in touch with Simone for a discount code for this walk. </p>
