    <h1>Marbury Road Edible Garden</h1>
    
    <p>Born out of a need for food security in Stockport, the group have cultivated a space for the local community to learn, to grow and harvest crops freely!</p>
    
    <p>Marbury Road Edible Garden is a volunteer-run community group focusing on gardening and growing food for the community. We also run wellbeing workshops, including yoga, mindful watercolour painting, sound and healing meditation and more!</p>
    
    <h2>Collections</h2>
    <p>We arrange collections from local restaurants and households that save their organic waste for the group to cycle back to the garden to make compost. Collections are on Mondays and Wednesdays 10am - 6pm.</p>
        
    <h2>Deliveries</h2>
    <p>We are also able to make deliveries. Working alongside Reddish Men in Sheds, we deliver handmaid gift boxes to referrals following a hospital discharge. Deliveries are made at a time convenient to the recipient by a volunteer.</p>
