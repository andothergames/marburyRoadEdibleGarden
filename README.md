# Marbury Road Edible Garden

This website is a landing page for a local gardening community group. The project began as a brief set at a two-day [CLICK Hackathon](https://www.madlab.org.uk/news/shift-click-community-hackathon-16th-august-2023) where we answered real-world briefs from local businesses in need of tech solutions. Post-Hackathon, I was asked by MadLab to develop the site further to submit to the [Making Good Prize](https://m4kingspaces.org/the-making-good-prize/).

UI designer (and past MadLab student) Jack shared lots of knowledge about design principles and collaborated with me on Figma designs. I also received feedback from Claire and Carrie-Ann from MadLab on the site's accessibility, responsiveness and design.

That web design is a different ball game to graphic design and illustration! I have been designing static graphics for online and print use for over 10 years, however web designs requiring interactivity and responsiveness across multiple devices meant I had a lot to learn. Looking back, there are things I would change, but as this was only my second website I am proud of how it turned out.
